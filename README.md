# Comparison

This is the source code written in R programming language, for comparing the difference of gene expression level (through the alignment counts of uniquely aligned sequence fragments tagged by uniquely molecular identifiers (UMIs)) for all expressed human genes of each sample at control condition and drug-treated conditions, and identifying those differentially expressed genes between different drug-treated conditions at specified false discovery rate (FDR).
