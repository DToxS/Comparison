# Comparison

This set of *R* programs performs the statistical differential comparisons for the gene expression levels represented as the counts of uniquely aligned sequence reads for all reference human genes. Such differential comparison is carried out for each sample at drug-treated condition, such that a set of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) induced by a drug treatment is identified at given false discovery rate (FDR).
